                        <p>The first week of DECO2200 - Interaction Design Studio was pretty chill. I formed a 3-man group with Jaeho Choi & John El-Khoury Antonios. Due to us already knowing each other, we decided to get a head-start on the first assessment task. We first read the design brief and unit of study outline and then made a plan of how we would schedule our time as a group. After class had finished and throughout this first week, we decided to individually brainstorm a few ideas that we could do for the upcoming assessments.<br><u>Reflection:</u><br>I expect us to have great teamwork when doing the assessments for this unit of study as we have previous worked together as a group before. I think we are off to a great start so far in terms of knowing what to do and the goals we set for ourselves.</p>

                        <p>From the brainstormed ideas that we had from last week, we decided on one where we would be able to implement an autonomous vehicle and have a screen-based interface as well. In total, we thought up of 12 different ideas. These included ideas such as an ‘Autonomous Wheelchair’, an ‘Autonomous Delivery Drone’, an ‘Autonomous Ambulance Drone’, and many more (<u>Refer to Image 1</u>). Our chosen pick was based off feasibility, novelty and also interactivity. So in the end, we chose an ‘Autonomous Garbage Bin Collector’, which essentially is an autonomous garbage bin that collects garbage from residential houses. With this chosen context in mind, we started brainstorming 5 research questions that would be important in getting a better idea of the current state and user problems that garbage collection has. These 5 questions ended up being:</p>

                        <p>With these 5 research questions, we decided to have two different user research methods to answer each of the research questions. So in total, we had 8 different user research methods. These were: General Surveys, Text Study Diary, Focus Groups, Card Sorting, Contextual Interviews, Individual Interviews, Observation, and Intercept Surveys. We allocated these user research methods in accordance to what type and kind of data it may obtain and which research question it would greatly help in gathering data for. We also divided the different user research methods between us. I was given the task of doing the Text Study Diary, Individual Interview, and the Intercept Survey. After sorting all these things out, we started doing our own individual tasks in gathering user data (<u>Refer to Image 2</u>).</p>

                        <p>This week was pretty hectic for me. For the first half of the week, I did all the user research that I needed to do. The text study diary was a one page of diary entry that my chosen participants would be filling in throughout a time period (<u>Refer to Image 3</u>). The individual interview was an open-ended interview where I asked questions related to the research question that needed answering, in this case it was ‘How much freedom do residents want with throwing out their garbage?’ and ‘What impact does the current garbage collection have on society?’ (<u>Refer to Image 4</u>). The intercept survey questions was a questionnaire that was asked to random participants, and participation was voluntary. Questions in the intercept survey were formed to answer the research question ‘What impact does the current garbage collection have on society?’ (<u>Refer to Image 5</u>). Other relevant background research was also conducted to gain more insight into the field that our group chose. With that, I was able to input all the main insights and findings into a visual report and submit my first assessment for DECO2200 - Interaction Design Studio.</p>

                            <li>Autonomous Robot Bin Collector</li>

In the end, we chose to go with the ‘Autonomous Robot Bin Collector’ and the ‘Garbage Robot Rental System’. These were found to have more interface interactions and would be feasible in 20-30 years. Knowing the path that we would take, we decided to take a short break from all this for the rest of the week.</p>

                        <p>After taking last week off for a bit, we were refreshed in getting started on the second assessment task. We started the week off by drawing low-fidelity wireframes for the UI interface for both of the chosen ideas. The first concept, ‘Autonomous Robot Bin Collector’ was drawn using a mobile format (<u>Refer to Image 7</u>), whereas the second concept, ‘Garbage Robot Rental System’ was chosen to be drawn on a desktop interface (<u>Refer to Image 8</u>). This was due to the environment that we believed or target audience would be in. At a resident, people would usually use their mobile phones to book things. But when controlling a whole rental system, it would usually be in an office atmosphere on a desktop. We also started looking for user evaluation testing methods. So throughout the week, we were drawing and searching. In the end, we ended up choosing three methods that we would each do. These were:</p>

                        <p>We were able to finish the drawings of the low-fidelity wireframes and to put everything into InVision or Marvel. After doing that, we started looking for participants for our user testing of our low-fidelity wireframe prototype. We chose participants that would be suitable as our target audience. For the first concept, the ‘Autonomous Robot Bin Collector’, our target audience were any people that live in a residency. The second concept, ‘Garbage Robot Rental System’ had a target audience of people who had experience in managing bookings, or customer service experience via a screen interface.<br><u>Reflection:</u><br>After this week, I realised how important it is to look for participants that only relate to the field of research. If it were just anyone, the data obtained would not be as relevant and useful when making the UI interface. I have grown again as a designer in my opinion and I hope to grow even more later on.</p>

After having done that, we started to draw out good and useful insights from them so that we would be able to determine which concept we would finally go with for our final idea concept of an autonomous vehicle with a screen interface. By doing this, we referred back to recordings of the user evaluation tests we did and documented the findings.<br><u>Reflection:</u><br>The first user evaluation tests turned out to be a success. However, one problem would be the lack of participants. But this could not be helped as our own connections and contacts were not enough, especially for the participants for the second concept. We even tried reaching out to actual council garbage workers, but they were not able to be available participants for us unfortunately. However, through this experience I have learnt and gained more knowledge in doing user evaluation tests.</p>

                        <p>From last week’s insight gathering from the user evaluation tests, we ended up deciding that the second concept ‘Garbage Robot Rental System’ was the best between the two. This was because the interface allowed for more possibilities than the first concept, and it was more novel as it was from the perspective of the handler rather than the consumer. The data from the insights also suggested that the participants were more interested in the second concept interface rather than the first concept interface. User participants also thought that the second concept was able to solve the problem of the current garbage collection system. Therefore, from this decision, we started making the mid-fidelity prototype for this selected concept.<br><u>Reflection:</u><br>There is not much to reflect about from this week, apart from the relief I feel now that we have decided on a final concept to work on. We previously had trouble thinking which would be better, however, with the help of the data obtained from the user evaluation tests, we were able to quickly resolve this problem.</p>

However, it did take some time iterating it according to the feedback that we got from the user evaluation tests. Although the mid-fidelity iterations are based off of the feedback and insights from the user evaluation method, we still expect much more edits in the next iteration we make.</p>

                        <p>For the mid-fidelity prototypes, we were able to test 5 participants only, which is pretty low. This was because one of our previous participants was not able to be free for a user evaluation test, and we were not able to get any other extra participants. However, even with the lack of people we found, we were still able to obtain useful and interesting feedbacks. We plan on integrating these feedbacks (as well as the feedbacks from the first user evaluation testing) into our next iteration of fidelity. The methods of user evaluation testing that we used were the same as the ones we used in the previous user evaluation testing. However, we added the technique of observation to each of them. This was because observing the interactions of user participant would allow us to see interesting things that may not be explained or noticed by the user participant themselves. Now our final job was to input all the research, testings, and iterations onto a visual report so that we could submit our second assessment task of this course. Once we did that, we were finished with the second assessment task!<br><u>Reflection:</u><br>Iterating is an important step when designing anything, and in this procedure of our group assessment task, it made me realise the importance even more. Having the lack of user participation in our user evaluation test was not part of our plan, however we are still grateful to the individuals that did participate. Although there were a few ups and downs throughout the process of doing user evaluation testing and the making of the prototypes, I believe we were still able to produce a somewhat decent quality of work for this project and unit. I have grown a lot as a designer throughout this process so far, but there is still a long journey for me and much more to learn!</p>

                        <p>After having completed the second assessment task, we started on creating the iterations for the high-fidelity prototype based on the feedback we received from the user evaluation testing. We decided to use Figma to create the high-fidelity prototype as it allows for more than one person to edit and work on it. This whole week was just to get the high-fidelity prototype done, and it was completed (<u>Refer to Image 12</u>)!</p>

                        <p><u>Reflection:</u><br>Not much can be reflected upon, but the same as the previous week. The thought of how important iterations based off of user feedback and comments is very important. The use of Figma was also new and was a great experience, different to that of Sketch. I really liked it and enjoyed this new software experience. I hope that we will soon be able to submit a good high-fidelity prototype! One that will be of adequate and high quality.</p>

                        <p>Throughout this week, we had used Framer to start making the animations and work flow between each page of our high-fidelity prototype. The program proved to be quite buggy sometimes in terms of getting actions to work properly as it was intended to be and coded. However, even with these problems, we were still able to create a really high quality of a high-fidelity prototype for our fourth assessment task of DECO2200 - Interaction Design Studio. We still have not quite finished it yet, and still require to do the walkthrough video, and a companion website for it.<br><u>Reflection:</u><br>I had never used Framer before, so this was a new thing to understand. Although I did not contribute much towards the main coding of the animations and stuff, I was still able to assist in thinking of suitable animations and transitions between each interaction that the user will be going through. Having this new experience of coding was really great and I enjoyed all of it. The world is design really is vast and I hope to learn all the experience that it has to offer.</p>

                        <p>In these last two days, we had finally finished everything that we wanted to complete for the fourth task of DECO2200 - Interaction Design Studio. The final high-fidelity prototype of the interface was completed and worked really well. We also completed the making of the walkthrough video for the interface of the concept idea, and the completion of the companion website was also fulfilled and linked properly to John El-Khoury Antonios’ website. Fourth assessment task was completed!<br><u>Reflection:</u><br>With the high-fidelity prototype completed, the main assessments of design in DECO2200 - Interaction Design Studio were also done. I have learnt a lot throughout this journey and through all the assessment tasks that I have completed individually or with my group. I have definitely grown a lot in terms of being a designer, but I have also grown a lot as an individual working in a team. I have also gained and improved many of my skills and hope to make use of them in the future and whatever workplace I will be appointed to. DECO2200 - Interaction Design Studio has been a blast.</p>
